Logic

Here it uses Dynamic Statistics . 
It takes into care Probability of each letter .
It calculates frequency of each letter dynamically after each guess and finds the best possible 
next guess.

For Ex:
if it makes an guess "s" then first we make visited[s] = true so that it is never guessed again.
also if s is right guess then we add it to right guess string and we narrow down the data set based on right choices so far.
we do same  for wrong choices.
